# Food-Recognition-System

It's a food recognition system that recognizes food items using state of the art deeplearning models .The CNN model was trained on a bangladeshi food dataset created by our capstone group members that has 58 bangladeshi widely consumed food items . The dataset is available on kaggle- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wasiffuad/bengali-food-58

TO run the system you have to add trained model in the home directory in hdf5 format and link it in the view file .Then when you start the server you will get a form to upload the image and run prediction . Also you should have tensorlow installed .

Upload food image
